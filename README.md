# fake-backend-interceptor

## Set up a HttpCient interceptor for backend-less development in Angular 4.3 +

Bellow you can find a very simple way to set up a backend mock that allows you to implement your angular app without having the server side running.
I've built the backend mock using the HTTP_INTERCEPTOR

```typescript



```

Then, add the interceptor to your app and thats all
